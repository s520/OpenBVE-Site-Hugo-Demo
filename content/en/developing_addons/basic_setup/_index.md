The following set of pages describes the process for developing addons for **openBVE**.

## Basic Setup for creating a new addon:

In order to create openBVE addons, you should first download the **openBVE Developer's Tools** :

<a href="http://vps.bvecornwall.co.uk/OpenBVE/Stable/developerTools_1.4.4.0.7z" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Developer's Tools 1.4.4 (2016-04-01)</a>

This consists of two major tools- *Object Viewer* and *Route Viewer* , and two minor tools *Train Editor* and *Object Bender*

These should be extracted into your route openBVE folder, as they require data from the main download.

### Route Viewer

Route Viewer allows you to render and view a route file. It supports viewing a route, reloading routes, visualising certain non-visual commands (such as *Track.Section* ), and jumping to stations and point of interest.

### Object Viewer

Object Viewer allows you to view the 3D model formats which openBVE supports. It supports viewing multiple objects overlaid, reloading objects, and generates a list of errors in object files. 

------

### Train Editor

The Train Editor allows the editing of a train.dat file, including modifying properties and values, previewing train acceleration curves, and plotting of train sounds pitch and volume. 

------

### Object Bender

ObjectBender is a utility that helps create curved objects from shorter segments, for example, a 25m-long curved rail from a 5m rail segment.

ObjectBender offers a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a command line interface (CLI). The GUI allows you to quickly create longer objects, while the command line interface helps with repetitive tasks.

The following is a list of command line arguments. Use these in a batch file to quickly create multiple objects that constantly needs updating(for example, multiple rails for different radiuses from a single rail segment.

Example: 

```
ObjectBender input.csv output.csv /n=25 /s=1 /b=25 /r=600
```

| Argument         | Meaning                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| /?               | Shows the list of command-line arguments.                    |
| InputFile        | The path to the input file. Can be a B3D or CSV file.        |
| OutputFile       | The path to the output file. Will be of the same format as the input file. |
| /n=Segments      | The number of segments.                                      |
| /s=SegmentLength | The length of each segment in meters.                        |
| /b=BlockLength   | The block length in meters. If zero, the object is not rotated for use as a rail object. |
| /r=Radius        | The radius in meters. Negative values are left, positive ones right. Zero does not create a curve. |
| /g=RailGauge     | The gauge of the rail in millimeters. Only required if cant is applied. |
| /u=InitialCant   | The cant at the beginning of the object in millimeters.      |
| /v=FinalCant     | The cant at the end of the object in millimeters.            |
| /a               | Appends to the output file instead of overwriting it         |
