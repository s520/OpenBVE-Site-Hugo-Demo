*Version 1.5.3.6*

My apologies- This is the second release in two days to fix glitches.
Adding colored vertices (Used in certain .X files and MSTS shapes) has proved a little more troublesome than first expected- There are a *lot* of places where changing a fundamental type like this can have unexpected consequences!

Hopefully this will deal with the last of them, but don't hesitate to get in touch if something is still broken......

### Significant Changes:

* Fix: Actually make the Object Viewer fix from 1.5.3.5 work correctly....
* Fix: Issue in certain train panels.
