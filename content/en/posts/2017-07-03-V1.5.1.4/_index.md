*Version 1.5.1.4*

__Significant Changes:__

* Fix: Improved handling of .Section commands with unexpected contents. (Signals could get stuck on red in rare cases)
* Fix: Departure occurring at the terminal station.
* Fix: When using the AI driver & certain .Net plugins, the reverser repeatedly bounced on and off at the terminal station.
* Fix: Rolling backwards whilst moving off from a station stop on a hill caused the it to trigger again.
