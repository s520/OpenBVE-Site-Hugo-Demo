Welcome to the new site!

As many regular users will know, the original developer (Michelle) decided to leave approximately seven years ago.
Since that time, a little work has been done on the simulation by several people, but no major updates or features have been made.

**That's now changing!**

As readers of the BVE-Worldwide forum will know, I (and several others) have been working hard on the main program for several months.

This is now available in the form of nightly builds from the download page, and a tagged release will be available soon.

### A Brief Overview on the Changes to Date

* The program backend libraries have been ported to openTK.
* Many small additions to the openBVE API and animated objects: <https://github.com/leezer3/OpenBVE/wiki/Compatibility-Notes>
* 'Proper' moving bogies.
* In-game loading screens and menus improved.

### Coming Soon.....

* Automatic package and zip file installation.
* More to follow.
