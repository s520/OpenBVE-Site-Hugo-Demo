*Version 1.5.3.10*

This build is primarily a hotfix release to v1.5.3.9.

### Significant changes:

* Fix: Departure did not occur when the doors were set to auto / semi-auto, & a station did not require any doors to be opened. (Introduced with 1.5.3.9)
* Fix: Under certain rare circumstances, an incorrect language could be loaded.
