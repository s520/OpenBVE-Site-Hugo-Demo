Another month on, and we're slowly getting towards a completely stable build (Famous last words!)

*Version 1.5.0.1*

**Significant Changes:**

*RC7:*

* Fixes a crash in the main menu.
* Add Panel2.cfg gauge type *LinearGauge*
* Improve the packaging & file locations used by the Mac builds.
* Fix several issues with packages.
* A _Train_ folder within the _Railway_ folder caused train searching to break.
